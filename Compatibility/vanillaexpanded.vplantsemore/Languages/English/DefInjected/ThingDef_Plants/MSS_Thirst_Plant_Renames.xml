    <VCE_Cucumber.label>Water Tuber</VCE_Cucumber.label>
    <VCE_Cucumber.description>A miraculous fruit bearing plant believed to be a legend amongst the tribes of Oilrakis. This plant is capable of thriving when planted in the driest conditions, and fed only contaminated water. When fruiting, the plant yields long, green tubers made up almost entirely of water. Extremely hydrating.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Cucumbers are only growable in sandy growing zones, which ignore fertility. These plants will however take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space. Cucumbers grow quite fast, providing little yield but in a short period. They can be eaten raw, and restore water levels. They can be processed into safe water at a cooking station.</VCE_Cucumber.description>
