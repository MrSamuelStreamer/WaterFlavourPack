    <GarryFlowers_Slavery_StatusSymbol.description>We do not have slaves, but instead have a hightened class of senators, and a lower class of workers known as plebeians. 
    
    Plebeians will not start rebellions against their senatorial overlords unless the majority have significant break risks. 
        
    Senators will get a mood bonus for having maintaining high moods amongst the Plebians.</GarryFlowers_Slavery_StatusSymbol.description>
