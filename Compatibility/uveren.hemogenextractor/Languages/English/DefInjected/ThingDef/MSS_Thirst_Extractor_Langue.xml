    <HemogenExtractor.label>Safe Water Extractor</HemogenExtractor.label>
    <HemogenExtractor.description>An illegal and highly macabre variant of the cryptosleep casket that hijacks the captive's biological systems, effectively turning them into a makeshift water purifier. Those contained within will be in a partial state of suspended animation, with tubles and extractors allowing for the safe, uncontaminated water to be taken from the captive's cells. Unlike a regular cryptocasket which maintains a perfect biological balance, by removing water from the person within, the machine will need to be repeatedly refueled to ensure metabolic process replenishes water levels.</HemogenExtractor.description>
