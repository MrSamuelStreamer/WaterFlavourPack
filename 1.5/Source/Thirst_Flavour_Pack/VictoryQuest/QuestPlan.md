# Quest plan

1) Archotech components randomly spawn as quest rewards, trade items, etc.
2) When you buy or get rewarded your first one, a new quest starts "sic itur ad aquas"
   1) "archo component seems to be responding to a signal, looks like it's coming from <new map marker>"
   2) Spawn new site. Site has Power regulator building. Building requires 3 archo components.
   3) On entering the map, start "sic itur ad aquas"
   4) on 3 components placed in building, allow quest completion. Reward - new site
   5) To get components, either trade or get from subquests (see below)
5) Second quest "ab aqua libertas" - same as first, but with "Catalytic separator"
6) Third quest "aqua pura ab antiquo" - same, with "Sterilization Plant"
7) On completion - access to archospring site
   1) Enemy Spawns?
   2) Interact with archospring to end game
